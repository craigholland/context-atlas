## Purpose
- Defines repo-level operational rules that apply before recommending a push or merge.
- Connects the local `__ai__.md` contract system to a single repo-wide preflight entrypoint.
- Establishes hook and packaging expectations for the standalone Context Atlas library repo.
- Keeps the tracked example environment surface aligned with supported runtime settings.
- Makes the visible runtime knob surface reviewable at the repo root as assembly defaults, memory defaults, and observability settings begin to grow.
- Treats runtime config dependencies as part of the visible package contract when infrastructure moves from ad hoc parsing to validated libraries like Pydantic.

## Architectural Rules
- Before recommending a push or merge, contributors should run `py -3 scripts/preflight.py`.
- The tracked pre-push hook under `.githooks/pre-push` is the preferred enforcement mechanism for local pushes.
- Repo-root policy should stay thin: package/runtime behavior belongs in `src/`, enforcement logic in `scripts/`, and reusable architecture canon in `docs/`.
- The root owner file should express repo-wide operational rules and delegate folder-specific rules to nearer `__ai__.md` files rather than duplicating them.
- When hardening slices materially change governed package or test contracts, this root owner file should still be updated alongside the nearer owner files so repo-level freshness checks remain honest.

## Allowed Dependencies
- may depend on:
  - repository metadata files
  - repo-owned scripts and hooks
- must not depend on:
  - folder-specific rules being restated here when a nearer owner file already governs them
  - hidden local-only push behavior that is not represented by tracked scripts or hooks

## Public API / Key Exports
- `pyproject.toml`:
  - project metadata, Python floor, and dev-tool declarations
- `__ai__.template.md`:
  - baseline authoring template for local contract files
- `.env.example`:
  - tracked example environment surface for supported runtime knobs
- `__ai__.md`:
  - repo-level operational contract for preflight and push readiness
- `.githooks/pre-push`:
  - tracked pre-push hook that runs repo preflight

## File Index
- `pyproject.toml`:
  - responsibility: defines package metadata and repo-local developer tool dependencies
  - invariants:
    - Python floor here should match active CI and local preflight assumptions
    - runtime validation libraries added here should correspond to real package behavior, not speculative future plans
- `__ai__.template.md`:
  - responsibility: provides the reusable authoring shape for local owner files
  - footguns:
    - changes here should be reflected intentionally in validator expectations and local owner files
- `.env.example`:
  - responsibility: makes the supported environment-backed runtime settings visible at the repo root
  - invariants:
    - keys here should reflect the actual environment surface supported by infrastructure config loaders
    - assembly and memory default knobs should stay intentionally small and clearly operator-facing
- `__ai__.md`:
  - responsibility: states repo-wide operational rules before push or merge
  - invariants:
    - must call out the canonical preflight entrypoint
- `.githooks/pre-push`:
  - responsibility: executes repo preflight before local pushes when hooks are installed
  - footguns:
    - tracked hook file is inert until `core.hooksPath` points at `.githooks`

## Known Gaps / Future-State Notes
- The current root contract focuses on push readiness and repo governance rather than deeper release automation.
- The hook path still needs to be configured locally in each clone unless automation or contributor setup scripts do that explicitly.
- The current feature branch is now in an implementation-hardening phase documented under `docs/Planning/Initial-Implementation-Hardening-PR-Plan.md`; follow-up slices should keep repo-level push rules aligned with those contract changes.

## Cross-Folder Contracts
- `scripts/`: root policy delegates actual enforcement logic to repo-owned scripts; changing script entrypoints should update this contract.
- `src/context_atlas/`: preflight should prove repo readiness without redefining package-layer rules that belong to nearer owner files.
- `src/context_atlas/infrastructure/`: supported environment variable keys in config loaders should stay mirrored in `.env.example`.
- `src/context_atlas/infrastructure/`: assembly and memory default settings plus structured observability helpers should not grow new env knobs without updating the repo root surface.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI should mirror the local preflight closely enough that GitHub failures are usually reproducible before push.
